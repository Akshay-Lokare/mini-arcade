Create a game where a user taps on cards to reveal them, and must match pairs based on memory.

🧩 1. Game Basics
📌 Objective:
Show cards face down.

When two cards are tapped:

If they match → keep them revealed.

If not → flip them back after a short delay.

🗺️ Roadmap
🔹 Step 1: Design the Game Grid
Decide the number of cards (e.g., 4x4 = 16).

Create pairs of cards (e.g., 8 different values/images).

Shuffle the cards.

🔹 Step 2: Card Data Structure
Each card should contain:

id (unique)

value (or image)

isFlipped (true/false)

isMatched (true/false)

🔹 Step 3: Handle User Interaction
When a card is tapped:

Flip the card (set isFlipped to true).

Track currently flipped cards (max 2 at a time).

After the second card is flipped:

Check if they match.

If match → mark both as matched.

If not → flip them back after a timeout.

🔹 Step 4: Control Game State
Maintain state:

Cards array

Flipped cards

Matches

Moves/Score (optional)

Disable tapping when 2 cards are flipped and waiting to be evaluated.

🔹 Step 5: Game Over Condition
When all cards are matched, show a modal or message like “You Win!”.

Option to restart.

💡 Hints & Best Practices
🌀 Shuffle Logic:
Use a simple algorithm like Fisher-Yates shuffle to randomize card positions.

🧠 Memory Match Logic:
Only allow flipping if:

Less than 2 cards are flipped

The card is not already matched or currently flipped

⏱️ Add Delay:
Use a timeout (e.g., 1 second) before flipping unmatched cards back.

🧼 Reset:
Implement a reset function to restart the game with reshuffled cards and clean state.

🎨 UI/UX Tips:
Show flip animation (optional for advanced)

Highlight matched cards

Add move counter or timer for challenge

🛠️ Optional Features (Once Basic Game Works)
Timer countdown

Best score/moves saved

Levels (more cards, more types)

Themes (e.g., emojis, fruits, flags)

Sound effects
